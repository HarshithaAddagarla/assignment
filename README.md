React 3x3 Matrix Click Game
This project is a simple React application that demonstrates dynamic color changes in a 3x3 grid based on user interactions. The goal is to:

Change the color of a box to green when clicked.
When the last box is clicked, all clicked boxes change to orange sequentially in the order they were clicked.
Features
Interactive 3x3 Grid: A simple UI that allows users to click on any box in the grid.
Color Changes:
A clicked box changes its color to green.
Clicking the last box triggers all clicked boxes to turn orange in the order of their clicks.
Sequential Animation: Boxes turn orange one after another with a smooth transition.

Implementation Steps
1. Project Setup
Created a new React app using create-react-app.
Added custom logic and styling to achieve the desired functionality.
2. State Management
Matrix State:
Maintains the grid's colors (white, green, or orange).
Implemented as a 3x3 array: matrix = Array(3).fill(Array(3).fill("white")).
Clicked Order:
Keeps track of which boxes were clicked and their order.
3. Click Handler
Defined a function handleClick(row, col) to:
Update the clicked box to green.
Track the clicked box's position.
If the last box (2,2) is clicked, call updateColorsSequentially.
4. Sequential Color Change
Used setTimeout to change each clicked box to orange one at a time based on the clickedOrder.
5. Styling
Defined a simple 3x3 grid using CSS with:
Flexbox for centering.
grid-template-columns for layout.
Transition effects for smooth color changes.
